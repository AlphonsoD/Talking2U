# Talking2U

Talking2U is a chat bot that can provide either COVID-19 statistics from around the world, or it can help check your symptoms based on official government guidelines. 

If the user asks for statistics, the chat bot can prompt the user for a more specific inquiry by asking which country they would like to check, and which province/state they would like to see statistics from (if this is applicable to the country). Furthermore, that chat bot will ask if they would like to see the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, or all three of these options.

If the user asks to check their symptoms, the chat bot will ask what kind of symptoms the user is experiencing using questions from the Government of Canada's COVID-19 self-assessment tool and, based on the user's responses, will suggest appropriate actions to take.
